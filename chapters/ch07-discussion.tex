\chapter{Analysis and Discussion}
\label{ch07:discussion}
% Introduction to results - what were the experiment findings?
% \section{}

\section{Benefits of Parallelization}

\section{Performance Variability}
% variability - different number of transactions/Adabas records per EntireX broker message - partial cause?
% dockerization, garbage collection - drops in performance
% entirex broker and postgres bottleneck?
\section{Scalability and Architectural Considerations}
% very scalable, however increased complexity, need to manage cluster and its health
\section{The Consistency vs. Performance Trade-off}

\section{Experiment Limitations}
% only initial state tested for "consistent" results and similarity - interesting how updates would affect, as art doesn't receive full data image
% interesting in future to test flat fields only or more periodic fields
